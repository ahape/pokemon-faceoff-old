1. Groundwork/Basic Functionality
=================================
[x] Add /scripts/* to .gitignore

[x] Change types a little bit:

    [x] IPokemon -> IPokemonDetails.
    [x] PokemonVm.toJSON() -> IPokemon.
        [x] Get rid of computed `pokemon` that is actually IPokemonDetails,
            rename `pokemonJson` to `pokemon`.
    [x] Get rid of types enum, just use string value.

[x] Check that your damage calculation matches the result when run through
    the logic from here:
    https://github.com/smogon/damage-calc/blob/master/calc/src/mechanics/gen12.ts
    https://calc.pokemonshowdown.com/?gen=1

    [x] Better yet, check against the formulas found here:
        https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/gameboy/907714-pokemon-blue-version/faqs/64175
        Section [M00].

[x] Add correct Nidoran names (-f, -m).

[x] Fix bugs with calculation:

    [x] 1HKO moves don't show 0% on enemy HP bar.

[x] Fix incorrect move stats. See this article for the correct stats:
    https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/gameboy/907714-pokemon-blue-version/faqs/64175
    Section [L04].
    - Gust being "flying" type.
    - Tackle being 35P.

[x] Add <empty> move option (deals no damage).

[x] Have first four moves be prepopulated by deducing learnset moves and level.

    - Walk through learnset for pokemon, collecting all moves under level,
      capping at 4.
    - This needs to be in some sort of loop that increases index of move slot
      every added move.

[ ] Combine column MIN/MAX H-KO and output e.g. 2/3.

[ ] Add column CRIT MIN H-KO.

[ ] Add edge case moves and their damage.

    [ ] Like Hyper Beam not affecting ghost types?

    [ ] Look through moves list and determine oddballs.

[ ] Add basic unit tests for the functions.

    [ ] Add tests that compare correct outputs.

[-] Streamline project.

    [x] In tsconfig, move KO to devDependencies.

2. Prettify UI/UX
=================

[ ] Import photos to use for Pokemon

[ ] Improve styling.

[ ] Add color to HP bar.

[ ] Save inputs to localStorage to avoid page refreshing clearing all inputs.

3. Advanced Features
====================

[ ] Add inputs for stat modifiers: (+1...6,-1...-6).

    [ ] Add same for opponent.

[ ] Add 5 more pokemon to "user" list (whole ensemble).

[-] Add list of learned moves that map to each Pokemon.

    You could possible scrape it from here, except you'll need to run your
    "scrape script" for every move...

    [ ] Add moves list to opponents view, along with emboldening the ones the
        Pokemon should know, based on its level.

Later on
[ ] Message KidZero about following issues:
    - Battle formula is wrong: min -> max
    - Bubble is wrong: should be type water
