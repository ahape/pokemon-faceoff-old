[-] Change types a little bit:

    [x] IPokemon -> IPokemonDetails.
    [-] PokemonVm.toJSON() -> IPokemon.
        [ ] Get rid of computed `pokemon` that is actually IPokemonDetails,
            rename `pokemonJson` to `pokemon`.
    [x] Get rid of types enum, just use string value.

[ ] Add /scripts to .gitignore

[ ] Check that your damage calculation matches the result when run through
    the logic from here:
    https://github.com/smogon/damage-calc/blob/master/calc/src/mechanics/gen12.ts
    https://calc.pokemonshowdown.com/?gen=1

[ ] Add correct Nidoran names (-f, -m).

[ ] Save inputs to localStorage to avoid page refreshing clearing all inputs.

[ ] Add inputs for stat modifiers: (+1...6,-1...-6).

    [ ] Add same for opponent.

[ ] Add 5 more pokemon to "user" list (whole ensemble).

[ ] Add list of learned moves that map to each Pokemon.

    You could possible scrape it from here, except you'll need to run your
    "scrape script" for every move...

    [ ] Add moves list to opponents view, along with emboldening the ones the
        Pokemon should know, based on its level.

    [ ] Show "hits until KO" for each move.
